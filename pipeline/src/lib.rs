//! # Pipeline Building Blocks
//!
//! This crate provides the building blocks for constructing pipelines of network functions.
//! There are two main methods provided for linking network functions together in sequence:
//!
//! - `StaticChain`: A trait for statically chaining network functions together.
//! - `DynPipeline`: A pipeline that can be dynamically constructed at runtime.
//!
//! ## Network Functions
//!
//! A network function is anything that implements the [`NetworkFunction`] trait.
//! You can look at the [`sample_nfs`] module for some examples of simple network functions.
//!
//! ## Static Chaining
//!
//! You can statically chain together a series of network functions using the [`StaticChain::chain`]
//! method. [`StaticChain`] is implemented for all types that implement [`NetworkFunction`].
//!
//! ```no_compile
//! use pipeline::{NetworkFunction, StaticChain};
//! use pipeline::sample_nfs::{BroadcastMacs, DecrementTtl, InspectHeaders};
//! use net::buffer::PacketBufferMut;
//! use net::packet::Packet;
//! use net::packet::test_utils::TestBuffer;
//!
//! /// This creates a chain of functions that first does a `debug!` on the packet contents then
//! /// sets the destination mac to the broadcast mac address then decrements the TTL value of the
//! /// IP packet.
//! let mut pipeline = InspectHeaders.chain(BroadcastMacs).chain(DecrementTtl);
//! let pkts: Vec<Packet<TestBuffer>> = vec![];
//! pipeline.process(pkts.into_iter());
//! ```
//! Note that `pipeline` implements the [`NetworkFunction`] trait and can be used anywhere a
//! network function is expected.
//!
//! <div class="warning">
//!
//! Keep statically linked chains short, ideally less than 8 stages.
//!
//! The [`StaticChain::chain`] triggers compiler/linker limitations, long chains cause long
//! compile times and eventually cause the linker to run out of memory.
//!
//! </div>
//!
//! ## Dynamic Pipeline
//!
//! You can also use [`DynPipeline`] to construct a pipeline at runtime or to dynamically chain
//! together a series of network functions.
//!
//! ```no_compile
//! use pipeline::DynPipeline;
//! use pipeline::sample_nfs::{BroadcastMacs, DecrementTtl, InspectHeaders};
//! use net::packet::test_utils::TestBuffer;
//!
//! let mut pipeline = DynPipeline::<TestBuffer>::new();
//! pipeline = pipeline.add_stage(InspectHeaders);
//! pipeline = pipeline.add_stage(BroadcastMacs);
//! pipeline = pipeline.add_stage(DecrementTtl);
//! ```
//! Here the pipeline has exactly the same functionality as the statically chained pipeline in the
//! previous example, but using [`dyn_iter::DynIter`] and [`DynNetworkFunction`] to allow for
//! dynamic chaining, including at runtime.
//!
//! Note again that `pipeline` is of type [`NetworkFunction`] and can be used anywhere a network
//! function is expected.
//!
//! ## Dynamic Pipeline with Static Chaining
//!
//! You can also combine dynamic chaining with static chaining.
//!
//! ```no_compile
//! use pipeline::{DynPipeline, NetworkFunction, StaticChain};
//! use pipeline::sample_nfs::{BroadcastMacs, DecrementTtl, InspectHeaders};
//! use net::packet::test_utils::TestBuffer;
//!
//! let mut pipeline: DynPipeline<TestBuffer> = DynPipeline::new();
//! // Add a dynamic stage that is the static chain of `InspectHeaders` and `BroadcastMacs`
//! pipeline = pipeline.add_stage(InspectHeaders.chain(BroadcastMacs));
//! pipeline = pipeline.add_stage(DecrementTtl);
//! ```
//! Here the first stage is a static chain of [`sample_nfs::InspectHeaders`] and
//! [`sample_nfs::BroadcastMacs`] and the second stage is just [`sample_nfs::DecrementTtl`].
//! The overall functionality is the same as the previous examples.
//!
//! ## Performance Considerations
//!
//! Static chaining results in longer compile times (due mainly to linker memory usage) but faster
//! runtime since the compiler (as of this writing) seems to inline and co-optimize statically
//! chained functions. If combining a few small network functions, static chaining is more efficient.
//! It is always possible to then dynamically chain the statically chained stages as shown in the
//! example.
//!
